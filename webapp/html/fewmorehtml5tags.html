    An article, according to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary,
     is defined as “any of a small set of words or affixes (such as a, an, and the) used with nouns to limit or give definiteness to the application.” 
     According to the Collins Dictionary, “an article is a kind of determiner. In English, ‘a’ and ‘an’ are called the indefinite article, and ‘the’ 
     is called the definite article.” The Macmillan Dictionary defines an article as “a type of determiner (=word used before a noun) that shows
      whether you are referring to a particular thing or to a general example of something. The indefinite article is ‘a’ or ‘an’ and the definite article
       is ‘the’.”
